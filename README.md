## Overview

Welcome to the "alem-projects" repository! This repository documents my journey in learning the basics of coding and exploring algorithms over the past 6 months. Throughout this period, I have been engaged in various projects, including website development using HTML and CSS. The primary focus has been on understanding language manipulation and building small projects to apply my newfound knowledge.

## Projects

### Go Reloaded

The "Go Reloaded" project involves reading text from a file and applying various text transformations, such as converting letters to uppercase or lowercase. It provides an opportunity to explore file input/output and string manipulation techniques.

### Mah Skills

The "Mah Skills" project aims to strengthen my proficiency in coding and algorithmic understanding. It involves developing a program that calculates statistical metrics, such as the mean, standard deviation, and other relevant statistics, for a given set of numbers.

### Text Manipulation Projects

This project category includes several small projects focused on text manipulation and file operations. It involves:

- Implementing a program that reverses the order of characters in a given string.
- Enhancing understanding of basic input/output operations in programming, including tasks like reading from standard input, processing data, and generating specific output.
- Exploring file system operations, working with files, directories, and handling file input/output.
- Creating a text justification program, learning about text formatting and line justification techniques.

### Website Development

In addition to the coding projects, I have explored the basics of website development using HTML and CSS. Although not specific to a single project, I have worked on creating small websites to grasp the fundamentals of web design and development.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the various projects in this repository. Each project may have its own instructions and details. You are welcome to dive into the code and see how the projects were built. Don't hesitate to experiment and learn from them.

## About Me

Throughout these projects, I have been on a continuous learning journey, gaining insights into coding principles, algorithms, and web development basics. These projects represent stepping stones in my programming endeavors.
