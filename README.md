## Overview

Welcome to the "alem-projects" repository! This repository documents my journey in learning the basics of coding and exploring algorithms over the past 6 months. Throughout this period, I have been engaged in various projects, including website development using HTML and CSS. The primary focus has been on understanding language manipulation and building small projects to apply my newfound knowledge.

## Projects

### 1. Reverse

The "Reverse" project involves implementing a program that reverses the order of characters in a given string. This project challenges me to manipulate strings and use loops effectively.

### 2. Output

The "Output" project aims to enhance my understanding of basic input/output operations in programming. It may involve tasks such as reading from standard input, processing data, and generating specific output.

### 3. FS

The "FS" project explores file system operations. I have learned to work with files, directories, and handle file input/output in this project.

### 4. Justify

The "Justify" project involves creating a text justification program. I have learned about text formatting and line justification techniques as part of this project.

### 5. Website Development

In addition to the coding projects, I have explored the basics of website development. Although not specific to a single project, I have worked on creating small websites using HTML and CSS. These projects have helped me grasp the fundamentals of web design and development.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the various projects in this repository. Each project may have its own instructions and details. You are welcome to dive into the code and see how the projects were built. Don't hesitate to experiment and learn from them.

## About Me

Throughout these projects, I have been on a continuous learning journey, gaining insights into coding principles, algorithms, and web development basics. These projects represent stepping stones in my programming endeavors.
